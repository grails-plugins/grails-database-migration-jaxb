h4. The first step is to add a dependency for the plugin in @BuildConfig.groovy@:

{code}
plugins {
   ...
   runtime ':database-migration-jaxb:0.1'
}
{code}

This should pull in the @database-migration@ plugin transitively but you can also explicitly add in a dependency for that, in particular if you want to use a newer version than the plugin requires:

{code}
plugins {
   ...
   runtime ':database-migration:1.3.2'
}
{code}
